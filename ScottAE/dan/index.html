		<h2> POSTED JULY 26th </h2>
		<p> Sorry I've been out of touch! I've been so busy, and I've been writing but kept missing my opportunities to upload things without having to put the people around me on hold. Anyway, here's what I've written between Sunday, July 8th and Thursday, July 26th. That is to say, if you scroll down to Monday the 9th you can still read things in chronological order. Sorry this wasn't prioritized more, it was always just around the corner!</p>
		<h4> Thursday, July 26th </h4>
		<p> In Fort Collins I roamed around for a while to get a feel for the town. It was lush with trees and full of people, so I was just about overjoyed to be there. When I was done looking around I went to a coffee shop where I spent the afternoon finishing the book "The Beekeeper's Lament" which was an excellent humorous and accessible chronicle of beekeeping's recent history with a major U.S. beekeeper's life and operations in the spotlight to provide personality and narrative. As it turns out, beekeeping is a terrible line of work and has been for quite some time. It's also really, really interesting. Having had little interest in bees previously, I now feel differently. Anyway, I finished this book and gave it to the guy behind the counter of the coffee shop when I was done because we'd chatted for a little while after I asked him what there was to do in Fort Collins. Well he gave me two free burritos, a cup of coffee, and a glass of hibiscus tea over the course of the afternoon as a thank you I suppose. Then we went and got beer when things closed up at five or so and kept talking about this and that. He was a really nice guy. </p>
		<p> Well as it so happens, I also got in touch with Kirk and Lori Waddell, the parents of one of my cousins' roommates in college, who very graciously offered to host Lesley and I in a nearby town. I was pretty well ready to spend some time with older folks (that is, anyone older than 30) who wouldn't expect me to drink beer and go out at night. I needed some slower time. So after getting that beer I headed over to the source from whence my two breakfast burritos had come, got myself a dinner burrito, and was intercepted by an elderly artist with whom I talked about politics for maybe an hour. When we finished talking and eating, I finally got going. Leaving hurriedly at 8:30, the thirteen mile bike ride I took from downtown Ft. Collins to the Waddells' took me along a river (I was in yet another town with beautiful riverside bike paths!) part of the way then dumped me in some not-yet-filled-in housing tracts of a size I had not appreciated from the map google presented me earlier. Needless to say I became a little concerned about how far out into the countryside I was biking and talked to Kirk who assured me it was, in fact, further still to his house. When I got there they fixed me some great pasta and shared their good company. Lesley arrived pretty late, having had a very uncomfortable rideshare experience with a new agey weed grower/dealer (sound familiar?) who, when challenged about his pyramid-power theories told her that she didn't have any life experience to back up her opinions. She was pretty annoyed and we went to bed shortly thereafter.</p>
		<p> The next day Lesley and I tried to hitch hike into Ft. Collins and failed. We got part of the way and ate a terrible lunch then hitch hiked most of the way back. It was a long day, though ultimately Kirk and Lori got back and we had dinner and hours of good conversation. We talked about generational differences and the hypothesis that kids today don't know how to fail, or are shielded from it by their parents. At first I was skeptical, but the Waddells' perspective had scholastic athleticism behind it and I could see where they were coming from on that front. Later we talked about all sorts of things, though mostly money in politics. All in all it was a great night of laid back, respectful, interesting conversation for which both Lesley and I were thoroughly grateful (thank you!). The next day we went to Denver.</p>	
		
		<h4> Monday, July 23rd</h4>
		<p> Lesley and I are on the train (Amtrak) from Kansas City to Saint Louis. I guess there are a few gaps in our stories that need some filling in...</p>
		<p> I got up bright and early in Laramie so I could hitch hike down into Ft. Collins, finally getting out of Wyoming. A young woman who was getting a master’s in education and lived in Laramie (it's a college town, I think the only one in Wyoming though I believe Cheyenne has a school as well) was going south just to get out of town and picked me up within minutes of my arrival at the sign for 287 at the edge of town. This was the same place I had stood for over an hour the afternoon/evening before.</p>
		<p> She was nice enough and told me largely about how miserable the winters were in Wyoming. Also about how beautiful it is there, about her earlier life in New Mexico... about how much better Fort Collins is than Laramie. Well it IS beautiful there, from inside a car. The mountains are gorgeous, vast, varied things with surfaces of dry death extending across the barren plains and blowing over long-since-desiccated sloughs, with gently inflecting slopes that end in little peaks on little hills next to big peaks on big hills. At least the extensions of the Rocky Mountain ranges into the area are beautiful. But all of it terribly unpleasant to live in I would say. They have snow drifts in the winter that pile up and float across the plains like dunes. The west used to be called "The Great American Desert" and I resent it's renaming, since I've been fooled all along. The only things in central to eastern Wyoming are dry wind and mile upon mile of snow breaks skirting the highways.</p>
		<p> I did eventually (it took an hour and some change to go a hundred odd miles?) get to Colorado though. Miraculously quickly, that is. All motorized transport is magic. As my friend Io likes to point out, petroleum has produced a variety of things once the objects of mythology and magic. There's nothing better to bring home the transportation part than bicycling long distance. This trip has changed a lot of my perspectives in interesting ways, but those regarding time and space are particularly paradoxical. My mental map has had Colorado smashed up against the West Coast ever since I'd visited years ago. In fact I've considered all the Western States pretty close to each other for a long time, since everything in the longitudes of New Mexico and west are "easily" accessible by car or motorcycle. As it turns out, Colorado is pretty damn far inland. The states all have much greater resolution, much less granularity in my mind than before. The thing is, I didn't really realize that by always travelling on the interstate highways my concept of space was totally undermined. It's predictable that one's concept of linear distance is compressed when they travel down a road, that is compressed along the axis down which one travels. You feel like you see a lot and do so quickly, but you see everything as if it's smaller, as if it's compacted. And I think this warps one's idea of the distances perpendicular to one's route as well, which is my real point. It feels as if you can get a sense of what's <i>off</i> the interstate by being <i>on</i> the interstate, since you see so much from that perspective. It's hard to realize what you see are just the walls of a thin canyon down which you're travelling at speed. Getting out on old highways on a bicycle has made me realize this. The world is incomprehensibly big. </p>
		<p> The paradox here is that now it seems accessible in a way I never imagined. I think there's a limit on the degree to which people can take in spatial information when they don't stay in it for any length of time. It's as if, though a photo may convey a sense of grandeur or vastness, that sense has always been more a feeling than a tangible reality to me until now. It's like my senses were never properly calibrated previously. Bicycling seems to have both calibrated them and made me realize the degree to which I'm mobile, capable, and physically unfettered. Granted now my knees are a bit of a problem from the sudden explosion in their use but I'm thankful to be gradually finding my way out of the sick societal norm of using my body in a marginal way with regard to its potential. I don't think I could ever think of flying the same way again; Of course it's convenient, nobody could ever argue that point, but the shrinking of the world is almost as terrible as it is powerful and beautiful. People hiked, sailed, rode, and biked their ways over long distances and long stretches of time to interesting different cultural experiences for thousands of years before global dimming from high-atmosphere moisture and particulate matter were ever conceivable, long before a person's mental map could consist of isolated bubbles in various "different" places. It's like nobody told me what my body was good for because the good jobs and the good stations in society are all cerebral in nature. Sure you can romanticize physical labor, which is an understandable tack from people who aren't slaves to it, but that's not the same as realizing your potential as an animal with physical resources resulting from countless previous generations' struggles in a physical world. </p>
		<p> If that was too much philosophizing on that issue, forgive me then explain our human inheritance to someone who hasn't thought about all that yet. Actually I don't know if any sort of "telling" could have made me feel the way I do now. Anyway, like I said, I did eventually get to Fort Collins.</p>		
		
		<h4> Monday, July 9th </h4>
		<p> I can't wait to get out of Wyoming, it's like being in a dream it's so weird.</p>
		<p> The most immediately strange situation is my lodging here in Laramie. I was trying to hitch a ride to Fort Collins earlier (yes, there's a story behind that too unfortunately) and nobody picked me up for the few hours I stood out on 287, which was a little humorous considering how long it took me to decide between trying that and trying to find something fun in Laramie. Ultimately, I had talked to someone who lived here who told me Fort Collins is way more interesting so I figured I'd try to make it there. I also have some options there for places to stay for free, which pulled me in that direction. Anyway, I figured if I didn't get a ride I'd go to this bar that supposedly would have some good music playing and young people around where I might meet some folks. Well I didn't get quite that far.</p>
		<p> I was walking back from the outskirts of town a little later at about 9:30, once it was actually dark and I had no chance at all of getting a ride, and it occurred to me that I could turn five of the 10 dollars I had acquired by standing on the roadside (yeah some guy got out and handed me a ten and told me good luck) into a subway sandwich. Subway sandwiches yield by far the greatest variety of vegetables one person biking alone can consume in a day. Having gotten to the miraculously open Subway and waited around inside for a while to no avail I decided to stand outside a moment and play my mandolin. At that point two street kids (they're mostly younger than me now, which is weird) walked by and I nabbed them, asking them where they were sleeping the night. They told me they were staying with some friends they had made and hey is that a mandolin? Then they got out their banjo and washboard, but I told them to hold on I was about to order a sandwich. I went inside and the guy working there told me we should play inside instead. So two street kids and I tore out some folk-punk one of them had written in a Subway at 10:15 at night. Then the guy gave us our Sandwiches and a bunch of free cookies that we ate while I tried to ascertain the likelihood of my finding a place to stay with them. Also the one kid had a dog which was a gigantic mastiff, pit bull, and akida mix, but that's just a point of interest. Another point of interest; The street kid with the more "punk" aesthetic was from Petaluma and knew Lesley.</p>
		<p> But back to the points of disinterest; I learned they were pretty good friends with this other guy who lived across the hall from the place they were staying and I could probably stay there. They would ask. They thought we could all hang out and drink beers and it would be a blast, so we got a 24 pack. Of course this was partially to up my chances of having somewhere to stay. When we got there this guy was totally boring, to me that is, though not to the street kids. It's amazing how many people get together just to watch each other play video games, say meaningless things back and forth, and consume drugs (alcohol included obviously). Every time I'm in a situation like that I think, "Didn't people stop being interested in this type of crap in high school?" Then I take a moment to re-assess the degree to which I think the situation represents people in my age group and also the degree to which it represents society at large. Actually, how much people babble about things in video games is always surprising to me. "Break his neck, break his neck," and "Oh hit that one with the mace," etc. over and over again. How much people can repeat themselves and tolerate the people they're with being totally inattentive and uninterested is amazing all in its own right, never mind what they try to say. But anyway, the point is I drank a beer, got bored, and went to try to find somewhere to sleep because the guy who lived there didn't give a damn about anything other than drugs and the video game he was playing. Company merely provided an audience.</p>
		<p> At this point it was pretty late. I went down to the cafe I had been at earlier to sit outside and use the internet. I more or less verified that anywhere I could actually camp was at least 10 miles away and if I wanted to stay within the city proper, which isn't what you would call a city really as much as a small college town built on a frontier town built on a railroad stop, I would have to hope they had bleachers at the school, a porch on some more secluded church, or some relatively good bushes somewhere. There was also a KOA within about 5 miles which I wasn't too excited about going to but I figured I'd rather see if I could pay 25 bucks and at least get a shower. That would be better than taking the slight risk of getting mugged and losing my laptop or the relatively likely situation of getting hassled by the police. Remember I have a bike with reflective tape on the tire sidewalls? Yeah, those are touring tires. It wouldn't be so simple to hide in this place, with one the highest per capita employments of police. Anyway, I passed a travel lodge and thought, "Why not ask how cheap I can get a room?" So I did. The guy asked me how much I could pay. Well having looked online and seen the price was something like 120$ I told him twenty five. This was as much as I was prepared to pay, and if the KOA wouldn't do it either I was sleeping fifteen miles away, so I told him just that. He told me there was no way he could do that. He even started a little when I said it. He asked me if I had any more money and I said yes, but that I couldn't afford to spend it, that I was on a budget. Well THEN he told me I could walk right out the door and ask the police officer in the yard for a voucher since I was stranded and the city would pay. So at about one in the morning I went down to the police station with this officer who wanted to know what was going on. I told him basically what I just told you, he gave me a slip which I took back to the hotel. Here I am (in the hotel of course!).</p>
		<p> But it doesn't just stop there. That would make the hotel part too mundane. Instead, the clerk kept saying weird things. First of all he kept asking if he could buy me a doughnut or something, which I could at least construe as his trying to be nice to someone without much in the way of means. I said I'd bet they were pretty good (since they were being baked across the street) and he told me he could think of some other things that probably taste pretty good. Well that was weird but I didn't care too much. So the guy's a weirdo. I've had more of that type of crap from folks at the pride parade in SF before so I didn't care much. Apparently he makes some kind of videos with his friends in the hotel. Then he texts me, because it's ok to lift someone's contact info from a motel registry for personal use. "Sad, the guy is messed up" appears on my phone and it doesn't take me too long to realize the 307 number must be a Wyoming code. I go outside thinking I'm going to tell this guy in person that I'm annoyed as hell he thinks he can text me. Then I see him looking concerned in somebody's doorway with an ambulance and decide it'd be better to wait until the morning and just pretend I care about being this guy's buddy. He seemed to think I was a pretty interesting person based on my short description of my traveling, housing, and employment prospects. Ultimately, after he asked if I wanted a soda both in person and via text he got the message, that I'm going to bed and don't need anything thank you, I'll talk to you in the morning. So he texted me good night and hit him up in the am. Well he was gone in the A.M. so I didn't get to chew him out in person. And I figured I could leave well enough alone and not call him.</p>
				
		<h2> Sunday, July 8th </h2>
		<p> I've sure got a story for you all this time. Right now I'm in Rawlins, which multiple people described to me as the armpit of the Wyoming. It's a normal enough place for this contender in the "least populous state" competition. I guess all in all they have about half a million people (the state that is). They were also the first state to let women vote, though that was apparently because they didn't have enough "people" for statehood or something like that otherwise. I should mention this is just hearsay, but it sounds about right.</p>
		<p> Last night I asked some kind South American gentleman (and his Nigerian wife) on the street about a hill I saw at the end of the block with nothing on it. I wanted to camp there and had heard there was a bunch of BLM land around so I thought I would see what was up. He told me to just ask around about pitching my tent in yards but to watch out, use my discretion, and not to trust just anybody. Then he told me he was remodelling a property with a backhouse for his son, that I could stay there, and that he was a witness. A Jehovah's Witness, that is. He had to explain that last part.</p>
		<p> Being prudent enough to pass up the 20$ camping nearby with showers (something I haven't seen since Duboise) I took him up on his offer. I debated for a while whether I really wanted to sleep in the totally dishevelled and creepy backhouse, which had a pleasant abandoned city vibe going on, before I made up my mind; I had no good reason not to stay indoors, even if it was musty and weird. Well about 20 minutes later, recalling my incident in John Day with Lesley on the phone (which I don't think I've mentioned yet! Next time...), I went right back to the safety of the outdoors and pitched my tent. If only my squatter friend Xander from Berkeley had been there. In any case I thought I would spare myself the possibility of half waking up at two in the morning and trying to chew my leg off or something equally weird. It was probably the right decision because I slept terribly and did in fact keep waking up.</p>
		<p> Well afterwords I went to dominos and this young guy made my night by responding favorably to my propositions regarding free pizza. I ate 5 meals yesterday. I'm so hungry all the time. Anyway, I had a good laugh as I ate my pizza because this car full of girls kept driving by and whistling at me. Nobody has anything to do but drink in Wyoming. </p>
		<p> So that was last night, but the night <i>before</i> was just as good. In a story telling kind of way that is, I'm not sure how good it was from an objective standpoint. I mentioned nobody has anything to do but drink right? Well I stayed at "the mad potter's house" or rather at the "Monk King Bird Pottery" studio in the deserted ex-uranium-mining-boomtown of Jeffrey City, pop. 107. The monk king himself is a guy named Byron who drinks from the moment he wakes up until the moment he falls asleep and makes some pretty good pottery in what might be called the mean time. You just show up at his door and he lets you in and promptly gives you a mug of whiskey. I took a photo of myself toasting mugs of whiskey in service station turned home/studio spaces for posterity. Anyway, I made a meal of pasta and olive oil for maybe the fourth time in two days while he and his two nice climber friends went over to the bar. Soon thereafter a classic meth addict with random open sores, twitchy behavior and all burst through the front door, telling me he "just had to get away" or he was going to kill somebody. Having had a mug of whiskey I felt strangely well prepared. After all I was in such a good mood... His name was Mark and he kept asking me for drugs, mumbling incoherently, then laughing and getting stone cold solemn again. Most of the things I could comprehend him saying to me revolved around the murder of his aunt, arson, and breaking necks. I figured we'd better play darts and I could hope he didn't throw any at my face.</p>
		<p> Needless to say, about an hour and some later, folks came back from the bar and commenced babysitting Mark for me while I hid my laptop and went to bed in the RV out front. The door handle was a vice grip attached to a broken off piece of metal and Byron assured me he and his buddies would watch my back. All in all the whole thing went about as I expected. The guy wasn't crazy, just a drug addict who needed to be entertained for a little while, so hopefully I haven't convinced anyone I'm too much of a fool for waiting it out. In the morning I left and commenced yet another day of biking into terrible, terrible headwinds, although this time a little tired from having drank all that whiskey. Never come to Wyoming. Actually Lander and the Tetons are great but as far as I can tell the rest is junk.</p>
		<p> On the bright side, this morning the Jehovah's Witness gave me a bunch of canteloupe, which was very kind of him. Anyway, I guess sometime later I'll mention more about Lander which I stayed in for 4 or 5 days. I jammed with some folks at the bar on the fourth of July which you can see in the photos. For now I have to get to Saratoga and hope the wildfires (did I mention the whole west is on fire?) don't mean closure of WYO-130 which I plan to take to Laramie. The Owen's Lake area is evacuated which is just south west of Laramie, and Rawlins is northish west. Actually one day in Lander it rained ash, so I guess I've been around a lot of fire lately anyway. Don't worry though, I'm not about to go riding into a wildfire.</p>
		<p> Best wishes.</p>
		
		<h2> Monday, July 2nd </h2>
		<p> So you've probably noticed by now that the "storyline" of what's been going on with me has been lagging behind the photos a bit. Sorry about that. Just consider them suspenseful teasers. That or turn them into a "build your own adventure" and decide what I did before I tell you by constructing an epic tale out of speculation on their content.</p>
		<p> Actually first I want to make a minor plug for the rapper Slug of Atmosphere whom some of you may know. One of his albums, "When Life Gives You Lemons You Paint That Shit Gold" has been a favorite of mine for a long time and I've listened to it a lot lately. I find <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEHTTFOwsDs">this</a> song particularly touching. If you're a fan, I really like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFfFjdB8AM">this one</a> as well. And I have to include <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqOWO6ctsg">this</a>, I can't help it.</p> 
		<p> Anyway, so outside Arco (Arco, Idaho, between Boise on my way to Rexburg) I went through this small town called Howe which was representative of a lot of places I've been; Everything was closed and for sale. You can see photos of it just after those of the "Atomic City" sign and the main street of Arco. Well a little ways past that, right after I got into the INL (Idaho National Labs) I pulled up on an RV by the side of the road with a guy standing outside and I figured I'd say hello. Actually right before the photo of the INL entrance are a few photos of our desert-irrigation program called agriculture which I found stunning. But back to the guy; As it so happens, the guy was waiting for me. He'd seen the mandolin on my back and said to his wife Lynn something to the tune of "I bet that guy's pretty cool if he's carrying that mandolin all over the place..." Well Jerry had a guitar, some music suggestions, and a big smile so I sat down and hung out with him and Lynn for a while among the beautiful and desolate INL lands for about an hour. They gave me an amazing sandwich (it had <i>real</i> vegetables and good cheese on it, things I'd been missing out on) and a pile of strawberries with whipped cream. How awesome is that? Well Jerry told me about how he used to bike around a bit, how he and Lynn were on vacation and out having fun. If you guys read this, I hope the rest of your trip was a blast. And thanks for the pipe insulation and duct tape you gave me for my handlebars. People tell me my bike is "old school" and I'm sure it's partially thanks to you.</p>
		<p> So I biked that day from Arco to Rexburg. They (in Arco) told me Rexburg was a college town so it would be more fun for me than going to Idaho Falls. Nobody said it was home to BYU Idaho however. I kept asking people what to do there and they were universally wary of me. Actually it was pretty funny. I was walking by these two girls on the street that looked like they must have been freshman, i.e. they looked young, starry eyed, and kind of in their own world, when I asked, "Hey can I bother you guys for a minute?" Needless to say, they held themselves a little tighter, huddled a little, and sort of continued walking/backing away when I started laughing and explained I wasn't from town and was just curious what there was to do around Rexburg. Well they loosened up and told me to go to some diner where they have milkshakes. I asked some guys on the street where I could get something to eat for dinner and they told me the town had a DQ, a Taco Bell, a McDonalds... etc. etc. This was not the college town I thought it was going to be.</p>
		<p>So I went into a Mexican place, the only sort of cheaper restaurant where I could get something to introduce variety in my diet and sat down in a booth across from their gigantic wall mounted light board menu. Well, the girl behind the register gave me this extremely uncomfortable and suspicious look. I <i>was</i> in the middle of taking my one knee high sock off my right foot (I had terrible sunburn on my right calf! It had to be covered!) but she must have thought I was going to sit there pulling it on and off all afternoon and ruin the indoor taco truck sort of vibe they had going because she asked if she could help me in just that kind of a voice. Again I laughed a little and said yes, I would be ordering in a moment and I was just looking at the menu, don't worry, my one sock was just to cover a nasty sunburn. She blushed a bit and explained it was her first day and loosened way up. In any case everyone seemed afraid of my decidedly unclean appearance, possibly since Mormons are probably the most clean cut human beings on the planet. Incidentally they're also some of the nicest. As it turns out, there wasn't a thing to do in that town because, as a nice young Mormon gentleman I talked to for a while on the street told me, there were no bars and no cafes and nowhere that people got together to hang out and meet each other, and one third of the student body was married. I also found out later that the average length of time Mormons date before getting married is two months and they can't watch R rated movies (maybe until some late age, I'm not sure.) Interesting stuff. On the cafe note, I kept asking people about cafes and it turns out nobody there had any such concept. They pointed me to a diner, where I went eventually, and seeing it was a diner asked the waitress if there were any coffee shops in town. She said, "Yeah, you're in one." I tried to say no no, I mean a cafe, you know, where you get coffee and maybe something to eat and you can just hang around and meet people, but she insisted, saying, "We serve coffee and food, ok, that makes us a cafe." Well I gave that up. There are no cafes in Rexburg and absolutely nothing to do. The nothing to do part was even pretty much the consensus among the students I talked to, but they were all married anyway and didn't seem to care about that. Maybe the campus is interesting but I got out of there as soon as I could.</p>
		<p> The next day I biked North to St. Anthony then hitch hiked to West Yellowstone since my knees were bugging me (hence the North sign in the photos.) The folks who picked me up first and drove me a little ways were a scoutmaster and an eagle scout running a camp in the Tetons which sounded like it must have been pretty cool. The next folks who drove me the rest of the way (I guess I got about 60mi of ride) were crazy as hell. In that particular way that hides under a veneer of sanity. They picked me up in a beat up white limo covered (internally) in dog slobber and told me all about the cannabis dispensary business. They had a shop in S.F. and were driving cross country to open one in Connecticut. As it so happens, THC is psychoactive as a result of its light refracting properties. Indeed light is a very powerful thing. One can live off of sunlight exclusively. How else could Jesus have survived forty days and forty nights with no food? Yeah well, they were pretty preoccupied with weed generally, and I didn't want to argue about physical processes of metabolism with them. I obviously don't know them well but generally I find that when I meet people with such extreme views about the nature of reality I tend to think they're pretty terribly misinformed. Anyhow, shoving my bike in a limo and riding up to West Yellowstone was a trip. I do have to give them major credit for being nice people though, and that matters much more than whether or not we agree on scientific particulars.</p>
		<p> Speaking of West Yellowstone, I should mention it will be forever tarnished (damn tourist town!) in my memory since a store owner called the cops on Lesley and I for busking on the street corner. Apparently playing music for tips on the street is considered panhandling there and is illegal. The officer, a guy from Chicago, was extremely apologetic about it. He told us all about how he loved street musicians and in Chicago there's lots of 'em and how great it is but that West Yellowstone had outlawed it so we'd have to stop. We gladly did but it was a shame because people were practically throwing money at us. We must have made 15 bucks in 10 minutes. We asked if it was fine if we just kept playing but didn't have a case out and he said it was. A few minutes later he came back because the store owner had called again and said he wanted us off his property, i.e. the three feet within his store on the sidewalk. What an asshole huh? Well all the folks on the street hassled the officer about why he was shutting us down and he was very apologetic to them too, and the store owners nearby all told us how un-grumpy they were, but <i>some</i> people were just too uptight regardless.</p>
		<p> After being in West Yellowstone for a few days, staying with one of the most wonderful couchsurfing folks named Kayte, Lesley and I went up to Mammoth and Gardiner where my friend Heather took us hiking and we all had burritos and ice cream.</p>
		<p> Right now I'm in Lander, WY. Yeah, I went through Yellowstone and the Tetons and over a 9660ft pass to get here. Ever bike from ~7k ft. to such a height in under 15 miles? I have <i>never, ever</i> used my lungs like that before. Seriously, try this; If you push all the air out of your lungs, emptying every bit down through the bottom, then fill them as high as you can so you feel like your chest is going to pop, that was <i>every</i> breath I took riding my bike up that pass. It was intense. That was two days ago. I rode from Colter Bay in the Tetons National Park to Dubois, WY. The pictures that look like mountainous stuff, including the torn up road and the big tractor on the pass near a rocky overlook followed by some crazy cliffs were from that day. Right before that in the photos are my pictures of Colter Bay on Jackson Lake, some northern peaks in the Teton Range across the water, and the bike ride from Grant Village to Colter Bay. That one was awesome. The photo of the two guys' backs is from Grant Village. I passed this totally amazing lake, Heart Lake I think it was, in South Yellowstone which was like a mirror. You should be able to see that in the photos, as well as some submerged logs. It was SO beautiful.
		<p>	When I was biking through Yellowstone I was with some friends I made at Madison Junction named Daniel and Derek. They were really nice people, folks I was thankful to meet and folks I'd like to stay in touch with. We did a good hike in the middle of the day around the 3 mile Majestic Falls loop, we rode around and talked a bunch, and hiked up an overlook hill to see the Grand Prismatic pool before going to Old Faithful and biking over the Continental Divide to Grant Village. They went a little further than I did, since I was trying to take it easy on my knees.</p>
		<p> Colter Bay was beautiful, but I was a little blue the day I was there since I knew I needed to take a bit of a break but there was a conspicuous lack of young people. As it so happens, most of the places I've been have been lacking in young people, something I didn't quite expect. After all, I've gone on road trips through weird places and state parks before so I kept asking myself, "Where are all the young dirty people?" Looking at Madison Peak and the northern Teton range stirred in me a very deep desire to hike up those mountains. Lesley reminded me the other day that apparently I always have this desire when I see mountains, but this was particularly intense. I was chomping at the bit to go hiking up there. But I was in grizzly bear land and didn't have anyone to hike with, since I was surrounded by old people in RVs! On that note, the most ridiculous one I saw was this big bus of a thing with a fully dressed Harley sitting on a platform on the trailer hitch. That's not all, it was towing a big SUV. So these people <i>really</i> couldn't leave anything at home. Yellowstone and the Tetons were RV land.<p>
		<p> I gave up on my mountaineering aspirations when none of the rangers could tell me if it was possible to hike up there. None of them had ever been. They told me the climbing rangers down at Jenny lake would know, and maybe I could take this or that trail which didn't go anywhere near the peaks I was looking at. I wasn't about to bike 15 miles to Jenny Lake just to not find anyone to hike with down a trail that didn't go where I wanted. So much for that plan.</p>
		<p> Like I said, now I'm in Lander though. Dubois was boring and the KOA there was a rip off but some old guys I've been vaguely biking with helped me out and put me on their ticket so I only had to pay the extra six dollars (it's 25 otherwise!) In Lander, camping in the city park is free, they've got coffee shops and a nice bar downtown, lots of young people, and everyone is friendly. I should mention I don't really drink and don't really like bars, but they frequently have nice people in them and things to do. Unfortunately this one has nothing to do but nice enough people all the same. In any case, today I hung out with these two folks I met in the park, Jay and Chris, and had a blast. We went bouldering in Sinks Canyon State Park which is apparently world renowned climbing, as is the "Wild Iris" area nearby. One of the most fun and interesting things I've ever climbed so far was this mottled face of rock you can see in one of the photos.</p>
		<p>And that's about what I have to report for now! Oh, by the way, most of the trails photos immediately following my Arco Pizza Dinner are from Mammoth with Heather. Then come the photos of more central Yellowstone down through Colter Bay etc. One other cool thing, the black birds in Yellowstone were huge. Some of them must have had four to five foot wingspans and stood as tall as good sized chickens. I mistook them for hawks at first they were so big, it blew me away.</p>
		<p> Warm wishes to all of you.</p>


		<h2> Sunday, June 24th </h2>
		<p> A few notes about photos: Those from the orange poppies in Arco to Lesley holding my "North" sign are of the landscape between Arco and Rexburg. The ones with water are the Snake River again, though hundreds of miles from before.</p> 
		<h3> A little bit of the pre-Boise trip: </h3>
		<p>At the foot of the Santiam Pass route some guy bought us a bunch of beer which was the first nice thing a stranger did for us on this trip. Actually he tried to get us to smoke weed with him but we both said no thanks, since neither of us like weed. Lesley didn't want a beer either and I don't really like drinking beer except (rarely) with a meal so we turned him down on both counts, but he insisted enough that we agreed we'd take one beer. We went in and he would buy us no fewer than six, since the hot springs down the road were <i>so amazing</i> we couldn't mess this up and not get enough beers. Which was ok all in all since I got six different beers, none of which I'd ever had. As a side note, Lesley was absolutely fuming that I had bought a beer entitled "Blonde Bombshell." Granted it was sexist and sort of distasteful but I hadn't thought about it and she couldn't believe I would do such a thing. (Actually as I write this Lesley scorns me and declares "Sort of distasteful? How about UNFORGIVABLY distasteful?) <a href="http://www.bottletrek.com/Qstore/Qstore.cgi?CMD=011&PROD=1183845406"> See for yourself.</a> In any case, the <a href="http://www.belknaphotsprings.com/hotspringPool.html">Belknap Hot Springs</a> were a little lackluster compared to the <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Photos/Misc/hot.spring.jpg">Owen's Valley Hot Springs</a> which were more in line with what Lesley and I had in our minds' eyes. In fact, we actually snuck around the forest and river by the resort looking for them for around an hour before asking IN the resort and discovering the sad truth, that they were "developed." Anyway, we soon enough disposed of the beers (that is, I drank half of one for each of two days, Lesley drank two, and we gave two away.) We didn't have to carry all that annoying water weight around anymore. If you look in the earlier photos, you can see Lesley, myself, and "that guy" just after our beer purchase.</p>
		<p> In any case the Cascades were wonderful to camp in, though cold and wet, because it was easy for Lesley and I to slink off into the forest and camp illegally. Basically any photos that contain the color green in the album so far are from the western side of the Cascades. That will change now that we're in Yellowstone however. The first thing on the Eastern side of the Cascades is Deschutes National Forest followed by the gorgeous and friendly town of Sisters.</p>
		<p> In Sisters Lesley and I met an interesting woman named Stasia from Portland who was on her way back along a three week long loop trip starting in Portland, going way out east, and coming back. She was maybe 30 and had just fallen into a job with the zoo as an outdoor education person who took young people on backpacking and hiking trips which sounded like great fun. She said it could be tough but was really low stress and fun since she loved the outdoors etc. She was the first to warn us that it didn't stay flat for long in Oregon, and was also the first bicyclist we met. Though I shouldn't get too far afield right now and should mention more of the trip up to Boise later. I do however want to take the time to say that in Eugene we watched Garden State and the ending sucked.</p>
		<h3> A little bit more recently: </h3>
		<p> This last week I biked from Boise south-east to Mountain Home (where the fire was) then east to Shoshone, up to Arco through Carey, and east again to Rexburg. The trip from Mountain Home to Shoshone was mostly uninteresting, although there are a few nice places along the river there. Mostly it was just agricultural land, and hot dry agricultural land at that. It's hard to fully realize the scope of our agricultural malpractice until you spend days biking through desert which has been cleared of sagebrush and irrigated. Or maybe that's not quite right. Maybe what I mean to say is, it's easy to realize either way but it starts to sink in with all the exposure. And the fact that there are no jobs there and countless rural towns are dying away further bolsters one's opinions on the matter. It's sad to see. It's also frankly strange to see the few young people in such places since it seems their aged neighbors present portraits of their later years. Actually a young woman named Dee, who I met leaving Boise was from a small town in Nevada. When I asked her what that had been like, she said she hadn't known anything else until she moved to Portland and now would never go back.</p>
		<h3> About Dee: </h3>
		<p> Dee was the daughter of two gold miners. Apparently they extract from some of these mines as much as sixteen thousand dollars worth of gold a night. Which I guess justifies their 24 hour, 365 day per year approach to mining and hence employment. Because working irregularly spaced 12 hour shifts and ruining your health when you're young justify such things. In any case, the mining process is somewhat interesting: Since the gold is microscopic they crush tons and tons of rock (it's almost all overland mining, which is a good thing for the folks who work there at least) bathe it in a cyanide solution of some type which leeches out the gold, then discard the solid material, sop up the cyanide-gold compound with coal, then heat the coal and out comes gold! Straightforward eh? You'd think we would just stop using so damn much gold, but I guess its utility in electronics is absurdly high. So anyway, Dee was an industrial worker at a gold mining operation in Nevada for a few years after college (she studied Sociology) then decided to book it to Portland. When I met her I had been eating lunch in Huntington (was it ID or OR?) on my way to Boise, had finished, and was standing around outside debating whether to take a nap or keep biking for the day. I was being pretty noncommittal so when she said she was going to Ontario (outside Boise) I said I would go. Why not? Well that was the first day ever I biked 90 miles which was cool. I took photos of what I considered an industrial castle that day right outside Huntington by the way, which I considered interesting and maybe you've seen. Anyway, Dee and I biked together and talked a lot for two days. That night I got to stay with friends of her family (camped in the back!) who you see posing with their two dogs at their house in the city of Fruitland, which is a little north of Ontario, in one of my photos.</p>
		<h3> Dee's bike seat... </h3>
		<p> A few interesting things happened on the way into Boise the next day. First and foremost, Dee broke the seat post bolt on her nice new Surly Long Haul Trucker Expensive Bike which she had tightened so much the cuff was flexing the bolt about 30 degrees along its centerline. In her defense, the thing wouldn't keep the carbon fiber seat post from slipping down so it had to be done. Unfortunately we spent a bunch of time scavenging for a similar bolt from our bicycles and broke that one too. Well the solution presented itself after about two hours of fiddling: Cut up some tread from a discarded tire by the side of the road, stuff it into the post and the downtube to make a friction stop, and hope to adjust it effectively enough. It worked perfectly and to top it off a woman from a trailer home came out and gave us a quick release which we stuffed enough washers on to use to widen our margin of error on the repair. Dee's knees (hah) were thenceforth happy with a properly adjusted seat. I should mention she had had something like four knee surgeries since she had played college basketball (yeah she was buff) and I was hypothesizing that one of her legs was shorter and thus accounted for her difficulty in finding the right height for her seatpost. But anyway, we finally got on with our ride. A little later we ran into some goats that had gotten out and had a comical time trying to be good citizens and round them up and put them back in their pen. Baby goats are possibly the most adorable of animals I might add. You can probably see video of such a thing on Dee's website which I'll say something about later when I'm feeling like writing a little more about it. Actually I'm pretty much tired of typing for the time being so tune in next time for "How I got to Yellowstone" and other misadventures.</p>

		
		<h2> Wednesday, June 20th </h2>
		<p> Edit: I forgot to add a few notes about photos. I saw the bird that's in the bluebird photo! (But for real) And also the tiny snake was a friend I made who ran into the street and got run over when it saw me. It was a little traumatizing. I would have saved it if I'd known it wasn't poisonous... Also note the shitty weather from craters of the moon to Arco. I'm glad the photos turned out the way they did since it was fierce and intimidating until I got used to it. And I saw Caius and Kaia as they drove by randomly in Carey, evidently headed to West Yellowstone which was a cool coincidence.</p>
		<p> Today I just hung out in Arco, ID where I had ended up yesterday. I was glad to have gotten here last night because I had thought it was further from Shoshone (where I started) than it apparently was. You might have thought I would have been bored since the town only has 1k people in it and to get a pizza last night (which I was craving TERRIBLY) I had to go the town deli but I had a good day. It's officially a small town since there's no actual pizza joint. But that's beside the REAL point of what I have to say at the moment, which is this.</p>
		<p> Yesterday I ate eggs and hashbrowns with TONS of sausage gravy for breakfast, a gas station lunch of legend (see the photos! It was only 6 dollars!) and most of a pepperoni pizza for dinner. I guess I haven't mentioned yet that anyone who tried to actually be a vegetarian in my situation would just die. Lesley eats pancakes for every meal which can't be healthy and I took the plunge and figured a meat IV was better than malnutrition. You know what I want right now? A bunch of vegetables, either steamed or cooked in olive oil. I would give my pinky toe for fresh food. All I get to eat is processed, low quality, undervaried corn-in-the-form-of-meat food. I have mixed feelings about my diet right now. On the one hand it's fun shoveling junk down your throat like a mad person and on the other it's kind of gross.</p>
		<p> But anyway I took today off since the last three days were so strenuous. First thing I did was lay in the sun all morning. Then I read about a hundred pages of a book called "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running," by Haruki Murakami, which is worth mentioning because he's a writer I really like. I've read a few of his short stories, and two of his books. Actually I left "A Wild Sheep Chase" in John Day by accident, so I only read half that. When I went looking to replace it in a book store the only book of his they had was this one. The other I read was "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle." Both are excellent, so I figured I'd read this one too even though it's nonfiction. It's been good to read as it afforded me insights into Murakami as a person as well as a writer, valuable things both. In any case I think I'll take up running when I get to the East Coast, and I would recommend any of his novels to anyone (that means you!)</p>
		<p>	So basically I had the most laid back day imaginable. With nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody to talk to, I decided to go downtown, where I literally stood outside a store on the main steet (I'll try to remember to take a photo of that tomorrow before I leave) and drank drinks all day. First I bought an iced coffee for 75c. I stood and I watched the clouds pass and the few people in cars go too and fro. And I stood some more. Then I sipped my coffee. Repeat ad infinitum and that was my day. After maybe an hour I was done with the coffee so I got a coke for 50c and proceeded to take up my post again. When I was done with that, I just stood there drinking water. I definitely stood there (occassionally I sat too) for hours. How many you ask? Beats me, I was busy waiting for anything to happen and was really content when nothing continued to be happening. I left when I felt ready to meander with no goals and no plans out of the position I was in. I probably had to pee and was getting sunburned. But it wasn't really much of a conscious choice, I just let it happen when it did.</p>
		<p> I had some thoughts while I was standing there, though not <i>too</i> many. One prominent feature which I took a photo of was a cloud which was really multiple clouds but had only just stopped being one cloud before I took the picture. Also I thought about genius. Murakami is not a genius but his writing is excellent. He mentions this. And he only sort of started writing on a whim despite other people telling him pursuing a writing career was strange and silly for him to do. He also just sort of started running one day. I can relate to this in a lot of ways, the just sort of doing things part that is. In any case, I know some people who <i>are</i> geniuses, and they'll never be famous for it. So these are my thoughts on genius: Some people are recognized for their genius and others aren't at all, for exactly the same circumstance. Society likes to think geniuses have some sort of buoyancy, like cream, and are therefore recognized and rewarded. This is a lie. Not that I care much, but this was something I thought about, however trite it may be.</p>
		<p> Now that I've written a whole hell of a lot, I guess I should say something a little less longwinded. I met two old folks here at the camp from Virginia who hiked the Appallachian (sp? native american words are too hard to spell) trail after they were sixty. They stopped when she broke her leg, but she still hiked out 3 miles on it and is walking around fine today. She has great posture. They square dance and her husband bought me dinner!</p>
		<p> Yesterday I biked a hell of a lot. It was all uphill unfortunately and the last 20 miles the wind was coming from 10 or 11 really hard so I was pretty sore, which is why I took today off and got sunburned. I literally looked at the same mountains ALL day yesterday, and I could see Arco from 20 miles away at Craters of the Moon (I went in caves there!) It's wierd being able to bike for an hour and a half and see where you're going the whole time but never (until the end) feel much closer.</p>
		<p> So that's that and hopefully in two days I can bike the 180 miles to West Yellowstone. Cross your fingers for me, since Lesley's already there (and doing much better! HOORAY!). I'll have to expand on her situation and last few days sometime later. I guess I should also note where exactly I've been this whole time route-wise since it's pretty interesting. But that's for later.</p>

		<h2> Mon June 18th </h2>
		<p> Just uploaded photos of yesterday since I couldn't wait; Leaving Boise and biking down to Mountain Home was exhausting. Since Lesley and I went to Boise instead of Missoula (and thus left the TransAm route temporarily) I had to rely on google maps and my pencil and paper for directions. As it so happens I was routed out to Lucky Peak Reservoir then out some "roads" from there. Unfortunately nobody, including the park ranger, knew much about the roads I was looking for, like where they went or which were which. As a result I was out a dirt road that was closed to motor vehicles, pushing my bike uphill through sand and rocks (totally unridable terrain even for my fat tires) for two miles, singing to avoid spooking rattlesnakes and hoping like hell I wasn't going to run out of water, turn around, and go the long way. When I had drank one of my two water bottles I found a path that looked like it went directly up the hillside and out of the gulch I was in which I hoped would permit me to see where on earth I was, and if I could go down the other side and be anywhere I wanted to be. Well I didn't die of dehydration and I didn't go the long way around either; I found the "Old Route of the Oregon Trail Scenic Byway" which was a slightly more developed dirt road, i.e. it was smoothed, generally free of rocks and sand, and about 4 cars wide. Since I could actually ride my bike again, and was on a road cars could reach, I felt considerably safer and went down this side of the hill, but not before taking a bunch of photos from Bonneville Point which you can see in the gallery.</p>
		<p> Well when I got to the bottom of the hill, I went the wrong way. =( Sometimes it's hard to go the right way when you don't have a map and the roads don't have signs and you merge onto them going the wrong direction. In any case, I noticed the interstate and turned around after a few miles. But I DID find a gallon of store-bought water waiting for me on the side of the road someone had either put there for people dying or lost accidentally. So I promptly drank both my water bottles and filled them up again figuring I was going to be in the middle of nowhere for the rest of my life.</p>
		<p> Some number of trials and tribulations down unmarked dirt roads later I got to old US 30 which was marked only as "Desert Wind Rd" but I knew it was right because I had found a house and asked how to get there. It turned out I had followed my (terrible) directions pretty much perfectly despite being terribly confused and I soon found myself at the junction of Ditto Creek Rd and Martha Ave, (look it up! It will give you an idea of what's around! use sat. view.) talked to Lesley who told me how to abort the mission and go to Mountain Home instead of Little Camas Reservoir, and continued. Continued straight into a BLM land wildfire that had eaten up the interstate that is. I got a few cool photos, and when I was ahead of it and not worrying about it much I stopped to get a drink of water, which was a bad idea and sort of terrifying moment. I should mention I was on a road paralleling the interstate, not the actual interstate. They had closed <i>that</i> and were still hesitantly letting cars (and me) down the frontage road. Well I was one of the last folks they let down that particular road since the fire was getting worse. It was interesting, the wind must have been blowing 15 miles an hour (parallel to the road) and they were coming along behind the fire and putting it out, presumably making some headway. There was a guy outside a big BLM truck jogging with a fire hose and wiping it out in front of him which must have been tougher than anything I've ever done. But as I was saying I had gotten up ahead of the fire and wasn't too worried. With the bit of tailwind I could bike top speed on the flat ground and must have been going about 40mph (yeah! FAST!) so I didn't think much other than "Damn! This is cool!" and "huh, those guys sure are working hard..." Not to mention there were people around, you know, in cars and fire-mobiles. But when I stopped and drank that water and watched the fire for a second, it dawned on me that the fire was moving really, <i> really</i> fast. And all of a sudden it was hot. Way hotter the the 90 and some odd degrees I had been biking/hiking in all day. And the smoke was blotting out the sun. And I couldn't breathe so well. SHIT! I got on that bike and pedalled, let me tell you. Well, my estimates had been correct, and shortly I was pretty far out in front of it again so the heart-pounding part didn't last that long, but when I got into town I was laughing so I figured I got a nice healthy bunch of adrenaline going...</p>
		<p> And unfortunately the photos don't do the story much justice. But I also took a photo of a spider and a car show in Boise.</p>
		
		<h2> Sun, June 17th </h2>
		<p> Yesterday Lesley and I went to the Boise Pride celebration, which was fun. I didn't expect it to be as big as it was, since Boise isn't really that big of a city and Idaho is conservative and religious, particularly Christian and Mormon. I guess there was a contingent of Mormons there who were pro gay rights though which is good, even if it seems strange to me. It was a lot of fun though, and I took a few pictures. There were lip sync performances and various things, and in one of the photos I took there's a woman with long brown hair and I think a blue outfit and high heels  dancing on the lawn with Lesley in the foreground; She was one of the performers.</p>

		<h2> Fri, June 15th </h2>
		<p> So right now, Lesley and I are in Boise, Idaho and have been here since Tuesday the 12th. The folks we've been staying with, Dustin and Pedro from CouchSurfing.org, informed us that Boise has a lot going for it. Not the least of which is, purportedly, incredibly cheap beer. While this did not enthuse me particularly, the two big burritos I got for six dollars were convincing enough. The cost of living is very low here, we were told. Unfortunately this resulted indirectly in our buying a 50$ meal in an Indian restuarant downtown, which we documented for posterity. It was delicious. Thankfully we made 45$ busking outside right after that!</p>
		<p> Anyway, so we've been here hanging out while Lesley's knee is healing. Unfortunately she strained it when we were biking over the Cascades and has been taking it easy ever since we got to Sisters (OR). We're both a little bummed about it but figure with a little time everything will be alright. And as a result our travelling has been a little funky. I'll expand on all that and what we've been doing to keep moving east a little later.</p>
		<p> It's worth noting though that the Cascades were amazing! Maybe some of you, like myself, have not thought a whole lot about the fact that the Cascades, which seperate the Eastern two thirds of Oregon from the Western third, are actually mountains. You know, mountains in the sense that their rainshadow makes the Eastern part damn dry. As a result, the change in scenery is amazing. Going from lush (cold) rainforest on the western side to the dry (still not so hot as far as I'm concerned...) ponderosa pine forest (Deschutes N.F.) on the eastern side and then into the "high" desert (the Columbia Plateau) was great. Contrary to what you might also think, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_(Oregon)" target="_blank"> this doesn't make Eastern Oregon flat.</a></p>
		<p> In any case, Lesley and I have been hanging out in Boise.</p>
