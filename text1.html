	<b>A TCP/IP Router Analogy</b> <br>
    A relatively easy analogy to describe the MidiXLate router is to consider the functionality of a TCP/IP router in your home network.  
	A TCP/IP router enables every device (physically or wifi) connected to the router to communicate with the internet or any other device on your home network.   
	Where most devices simply connect to the internet (like your cell phone, FireTV, or Roku), while some devices connect to other devices on your home network. 
	For example your PC connects to your network printer. 
    <br><br>
    On a home network, most devices connect to you router via WiFi and DHCP, meaning the TCP/IP router configures the device connection without cables 
	and automatically. For example, when you connect your cell phone to your home's wireless network, a WiFi and DHCP connection is established.  
	Alternatively, you can physically connect devices (such as PCs and printers) to your router via a CAT5 network cables. 
	Next, you can manually configure your network devices via a browser connection to your router.  
    <br><br>
    In addition to configuring TCP/IP devices, a TCP/IP router can also perform 'Network Address Translation' or NAT.  NAT provides for more granular routing of TCP/IP packets on your TCP/IP network. 
    <br><br>
    MidiXLate provides similar functionality to the TCP/IP functionality just described, except on a Midi network.
    On a midi network there is no DHCP and no WiFi to automate the connection of Midi devices. Rather Midi devices are connected using Midi cables.  Midi routing information is defined on your PC program and downloaded to the MidiXLate router via USB cable. Conceptually, routing of midi packets is identical to routing of TCP/IP packets.
    <br><br> 
    MidiXLate also provides 'midi translation' and 'midi channel locking' functionality, which is discussed below.
    <br><br> 
	
    <b>Why MidiXLate</b> <br>
    The MidiXLate router is designed to provide enhanced Midi functionality and control over your Midi network. MidiXLate provides discrete Midi routing, granular Midi translation, and simple Midi channel locking features.  Before explaining the benefits of the MidiXLate router, let's start with a brief mention of the Midi issues that MidiXLate endeavors to solve.
    <br><br> 
    <b>USB to Midi converter cables</b> <br>
    This solution is a simple point-to-point midi connection. For example, assume you connect a keyboard (midi connector) to your PC DAW (USB connector).  This is a Midi point to point connection. Point to point midi is very limited because you have to work solely within the Midi constrains of your keyboard and PC.  Foe a simple example,  assume your keyboard only operates over one Midi channel but your PC DAW requires control over multiple channels.  There may be no elegant solution.  Lastly, point to point Midi does not allow simultaneous control of multiple Midi devices.  Using Midi 'thru ports' is typically less than ideal.  
    <br><br>  
    <b>Midi Hubs</b> <br>
    Midi hubs can be a nightmare in large Midi networks because Midi hubs typically broadcasts Midi data recived from one port to all Midi devices connected to the hub.  Managing this Midi network is very difficult and fought with unwanted side effects.  Not only do you need to manage the Midi tasks you want to control, you also need to manage the Midi tasks you don't want (ie: unwanted side effects).  Hubs are dumb devices that generate excess Midi network traffic, increase network latency, and provide no software control, no configurable routing capability, and no software configurable midi translation
